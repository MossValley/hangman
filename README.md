A terminal game of "hangman"  made as part of The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming

The computer selects a word between 5 and 12 characters from a dictionary txt file and the player has 10 guesses to guess the word.

**Currently**
* Game still shows word chosen - for bug fixing - to be removed in final game

**Need to add**
* Game saving function

**Extra features to add?**
* Drawing an actual stick man for incorrect guesses
* Player choosing length of word range and/or number of guesses
